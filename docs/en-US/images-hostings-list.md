## List of hosting sites for pictures

This page provides a list of all kinds of services that allow _to upload images to them and_ share links to downloaded images.

If you don’t understand why you need so much and are wondering what is the point in so many image hosting sites, then most likely you don’t understand why create mirror links at all. If so, read [why do this](/ru-RU/introduction?id=%d0%9a%d0%be%d0%bc%d1%83-%d0%b8-%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%bc-%d1%8d%d1%82%d0%be-%d0%bd%d1%83%d0%b6%d0%bd%d0%be).

I also want to note that it’s not worth publishing pictures on a service that has no ads at all and you don’t understand where the service comes from. It is possible that after some time, such a service may cease to exist and all the files that you uploaded to it will become completely inaccessible. This, for example, happened with the hosting http://tinypic.com/ and https://imgsafe.org/ (but then imgsafe came to life, but without saving the previous pictures).

Also, I advise you to create a registration on the hosting where you will upload pictures (if there is registration on it). This will help you look at the statistics and not lose the pictures if the post with your picture is deleted, and there will be no duplicate on the computer, and there is also the benefit of uploading pictures to your account. No, you do not need to register in such services with your main work mail, it’s better to create a separate mail account for this, but register on a picture hosting service before downloading.

All these image hosts have a lot in common and a lot of different things. Maybe someday I will arrange a comparison, but this is not accurate.

All these links (rows) are located in the tables with almost no sorting or sorting. The only thing I did was to render some popular, in my opinion, services in the first rows of the table.

### Image hosting supporting multiple image formats

This category contains a list of services on which you can upload images of several formats, for example, `PNG`, `JPG`, `GIF` or others.

### Alternative image hosting options

This category contains a list of services whose purpose is not to store and deliver pictures to the user, but their functionality also includes such an opportunity and these services can also be used as image hosting.

It is worth recalling that many cloud storage can also be used as image hosting, but you will have to copy the URL of each image manually.

| Vkontakte             | https://vk.com/                | This social network, but you can upload pictures to it. They are automatically converted to JPG format (if you do not download them as a document) and a little **are compressed**. You can create a private group / community and upload pictures to this group / community, and then copy the direct link to the picture and use it anywhere. If a post or private message with a picture is deleted, the picture will still be available via a direct link. |
| Google Photo          | https://photos.google.com/     | Although the service is designed to host your photos, it is not intended to be embedded in other sites. However, if you want to host photos on Google’s servers, you can upload them to Google Photos, then open them and copy the direct link to each photo manually. Also, most likely, all images are compressed and upload images without loss of quality, probably will not work.                                                                         |
| Yandex.Colletions     | https://yandex.ru/collections/ | There used to be a Yandex.Fotki service, but it was redone in Yandex.Collections. We act in much the same way as with Google Photos - we upload a picture, open it manually and right-click on the picture and copy the direct link to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Mail. My World. Photo | https://my.mail.ru/my/photo    | Not very popular and not very developing service. Everything is done the same way as in previous cases, we upload a picture, open it, RMB on it and copy the direct link to the picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## How this page was formed

The name of the services is taken from the main pages of these services, or the domain name is simply copied and capitalized if its name on the main page of the service is the same as the domain name.

If you are wondering how I could find out about such a number of image hosting sites, then the answer is quite simple - at a certain point (some number of years ago) I was interested to find out what image hosting sites exist besides the main leaders. I began to look at the URL of almost every image on the forums that I visited and where people themselves posted pictures and did not attach them to the post using the built-in forum tools. First, I opened each picture in a new tab, looked at the URL, went to the main domain of the picture and added it to bookmarks. Then I found out about the extension[Image Size Info](https://www.igorware.com/extensions/image-size-info?referrer-ver=chrome-ext-manager) for the Google Chrome browser, and things went faster, because less work was required. So, looking at the URL of almost every image on the forums, I put together this list of image hosting sites.
