## List of file hosts

This page provides a list of all kinds of services that allow _free uploading to them_ files of various formats and _sharing links_ to downloaded files.

If you do not understand why you need so many services with the same functionality and wonder what is the point in so many file hosting sites, then most likely you do not understand why create mirror links at all. If so, read [why do this](/ru-RU/introduction?id=%d0%9a%d0%be%d0%bc%d1%83-%d0%b8-%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%bc-%d1%8d%d1%82%d0%be-%d0%bd%d1%83%d0%b6%d0%bd%d0%be).

I also want to note that it’s not worth publishing files on a service that does not have ads at all and you don’t understand where the service comes from. It is possible that after some time, such a service may cease to exist and all the files that you uploaded to it will become completely inaccessible. This, for example, happened with image hosting http://tinypic.com/ and https://imgsafe.org/ (but then imgsafe came to life, but without saving the previous images). It was the same with cloud storage. [Wuala](https://wuala.com/), Copy, LeCloud, etc.

Also, I advise you to register on a hosting where you will upload files (if there is registration on it). This will help you look at the statistics and not lose the pictures if the post with your mirror link is deleted and there is no duplicate on the computer. There is another benefit of uploading files to your account, and not just anonymously. No, you do not need to register in such services with your main work mail, it’s better to create a separate mail account for this, but register on a picture hosting service before downloading.

All of these file hosting services have much in common and many different things. Maybe someday I will arrange a comparison, but this is not accurate.

All these links (rows) are located in the tables with almost no sorting or sorting. The only thing I did was to render some popular, in my opinion, services in the first rows of the table.

### Cloud storages

In this category there is a list of services to which you can upload files and **freely download** they also freely **share** them.

### Files Hostings - Files Sharing services

This category contains a list of services where you can upload files of different formats and share them. The difference between these services and cloud storage is that file hosting has significant limitations compared to "clouds", for example, short-term storage or low download speed and others.

In the spoken language, often such services are called not file hosting, but simply file sharing.

| VKontakte    | https://vk.com/ | The VK social network has the ability to upload documents of almost any format up to 200 MB in size. You cannot download executable files (`.exe`,`.msi` and others) and archives that contain these files, but you can always archive the archive again in a different format. The advantage is that after downloading the file, the generated link to the file is actually direct and when you click on it, the file is downloaded immediately. Of the minuses, I can note that when you delete an account, all document files become inaccessible to no one, and the file names always change to English characters. |

## What is the difference between cloud storage and file hosting

In my opinion the question is rather rhetorical.

Each cloud storage is a file hosting for the account owner and some place in this "cloud", this is unique.

But file hosting, the list of which I cited above, I would not call cloud storage, although some of them are much similar.

Cloud storage and file sharing have common features, but there are also strong differences. The fact is that the overwhelming majority of file hosting companies try to monetize everything that lends itself to monetization - download speed, shelf life, size of the downloaded file, the amount of traffic consumed, the presence of advertising, etc. Some cloud storages also have some of these features, for example, _mediafire_ deletes an account and all files on it after 180 days of inactivity, Mega introduces a limit on the number of downloaded traffic, etc.

I propose for the criterion by which you can distinguish between ordinary user cloud storage and file hosting, to take such a function as unhindered file downloads for the file owner, not counting the restrictions on downloaded traffic. Because in almost all file hosting services you download the files that you uploaded to your account on the service with exactly the same restrictions as any other user, but in the cloud storages, although restrictions may be imposed on the download of the file that you opened via the link on some site, but I haven’t seen (or don’t remember) cloud storages that would somehow limit the download speed if you download your files from the "cloud" interface in your account.

## How this page was formed

The name of the services is taken from the main pages of these services, or the domain name is simply copied and written with a capital letter or in the format [PascalCase](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).

If you are wondering how I could find out about so many file hosting sites, then the answer is quite simple - at some point (some number of years ago) I was interested to find out what file hosting services exist, in addition to the main leaders. I began to analyze links wherever I saw them, where live people share them - on the forums that I visited, on social networks, and also looked at lists of hosted hosting services for multi-file uploading to several hosting sites.
