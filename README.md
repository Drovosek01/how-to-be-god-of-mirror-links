# How be God of mirror links

[РУССКИй](./README-RU.md) | ENGLISH

This is a repository with instructions on how to create mirror links. The instruction is made in the form of documentation from Markdown files based on the site generator with documentation[docsify](https://docsify.js.org).

If you just want to read this manual online, go to https://drovosek01.github.io/how-to-be-god-of-mirror-links/ and learn.

## Quick start

The structure is designed in such a way that it is possible to run a local server and read the documentation offline in a single page application. docsify makes a file folder site on the fly, so you get documentation in the form of [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).

If you want to read the manual offline in a convenient way, you will need to start a local server that will listen to the `docs` folder. docsify-cli provides this functionality. You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), after installation, it is better to restart your computer.

Install docsify-cli. Run command prompt / terminal and execute this command

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Clone this repository and move to the repository folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drovosek01/how-to-be-god-of-mirror-links.git
cd how-to-be-god-of-mirror-links
```

Start the server, which will make a one-page application from the documentation folder by running the latest commands

```bash
docsify serve docs
```
